      "['When one stops to recollect upon the frequent on screen teaming of Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland, \"They Died With Their Boots On\" (1941) is most likely the film remembered best. It is the sweeping saga of General Custer (Flynn) - told from the time he enters West Point military academy and falls for the luscious Elizabeth Bacon (DeHavilland), through his tenure during the American Civil War, and finally with his death at Little Big Horn. Director, Raoul Walsh mounts his historical epic on the laurels of highly questionable recanting of historical texts, rewritten by screen writers Wally Kline and Aeneas MacKenzie, until truth and fiction are warped all out of proportion. Hence, the battle against Chief Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn) is portrayed as a crooked deal between politicians - California Joe (Charley Grapewin) and a spuriously absent corporation which wants to reclaim the land Custer gave to the Indians through the systematic genocide of the Nation\\'s first peoples. <br /><br />Flynn, who cleverly plays Custer as though he is one part Arnold Schwartzenegger to two parts Albert Schweitzer, has never been more ignoble. He literally oozes charm and sex appeal from every pore that easily melts the heart of his loyal heroine. Resident Warner stock players, Arthur Kennedy and Sidney Greenstreet deliver marvelous cameos that appear to have far more depth and character than is actually written into the material for them.<br /><br />Overall, then, despite its loose rendering of history in favor of a good romantic yarn, \"They Died With Their Boots On\" is ample film fodder for a Saturday matinÃ©e or Sunday night cooing with one\\'s sweetheart. Warner\\'s DVD is pretty nice looking. Although film grain is often obvious, the gray scale has been very nicely rendered with deep, solid blacks and very clean whites. Some fading is obvious during scene transitions. The audio has been very nicely cleaned up and is presented at an adequate listening level.']\n",

      "['When one stops to recollect upon the frequent on screen teaming of Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland, \"They Died With Their Boots On\" (1941) is most likely the film remembered best. It is the sweeping saga of General Custer (Flynn) - told from the time he enters West Point military academy and falls for the luscious Elizabeth Bacon (DeHavilland), through his tenure during the American Civil War, and finally with his death at Little Big Horn. Director, Raoul Walsh mounts his historical epic on the laurels of highly questionable recanting of historical texts, rewritten by screen writers Wally Kline and Aeneas MacKenzie, until truth and fiction are warped all out of proportion. Hence, the battle against Chief Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn) is portrayed as a crooked deal between politicians - California Joe (Charley Grapewin) and a spuriously absent corporation which wants to reclaim the land Custer gave to the Indians through the systematic genocide of the Nation\\'s first peoples. <br /><br />Flynn, who cleverly plays Custer as though he is one part Arnold Schwartzenegger to two parts Albert Schweitzer, has never been more ignoble. He literally oozes charm and sex appeal from every pore that easily melts the heart of his loyal heroine. Resident Warner stock players, Arthur Kennedy and Sidney Greenstreet deliver marvelous cameos that appear to have far more depth and character than is actually written into the material for them.<br /><br />Overall, then, despite its loose rendering of history in favor of a good romantic yarn, \"They Died With Their Boots On\" is ample film fodder for a Saturday matinÃ©e or Sunday night cooing with one\\'s sweetheart. Warner\\'s DVD is pretty nice looking. Although film grain is often obvious, the gray scale has been very nicely rendered with deep, solid blacks and very clean whites. Some fading is obvious during scene transitions. The audio has been very nicely cleaned up and is presented at an adequate listening level.']\n",

      "[\"This is a Hollywood film. The credentials of those involved are not revolutionary. This film will not change the world. However, it is well-made, well-plotted, and well-acted, which counts for a lot.<br /><br />It's the cat-and-mouse story of a disgruntled former-CIA assassin who feels betrayed chasing a Secret Service agent who was protecting John F. Kennedy when Kennedy was killed in Dallas. The agent has been understandably troubled by this failure during the subsequent years of his career and when the movie picks up in 1992-or certainly in contemporary America, this would-be assassin Mitch Leary (John Malkovich in a tour-de-force of creepiness in which he gives a transformative performance) has been consumed with frustration and anger and decides that he is going to assassinate the President. He imagines he has common cause with Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood at his cool, calm, good-naturedly grouchy best) who he believes should hold a grudge as he does because the Warren Commission, blamed Horrigan-unfairly, Leary believes-for the assassination of President Kennedy. The tension is ratcheted up through some phone calls from Leary to Horrigan-Leary wanting to keep Horrigan close but not to betray his location and plans.<br /><br />Rene Russo is excellent as Lily Raines a fellow agent with whom Horrigan develops a grown- up relationship. It is nice to see a relationship between two equally competent peers (even if Russo is a fair deal younger than Eastwood at the time of filming). Russo is a calm, capable agent who is able to go toe-to-toe with the quick-witted Horrigan in friendly banter. It is a nice part for Russo, allowing her to play the role of a capable professional woman and not just the default romantic interest of the older man. The acting by the leads, Wolfgang Peterson's competent direction, the thoughtful use of music in plot development, and excellent cinematography make this a film I can watch over and over.\"]\n",

This could be because of a number of reasons. For one, the inclusion of stop words likely affects how the CNN interprets this review, especially because the review clearly changes sentiment throughout. In either case, it is interesting that the inclusion of the embeddings from the USE allowed the model to tease out that this was a positive sentiment when the regular CNNs (with only word level embeddings) were unable to get this one correct."

As such, it is impossible within the space of a short review to do justice to the range of ideas and experiences synthesized therein, (e.g. complexity theory, dream interpretation, natural morality, religious symbolism, sex, spiritual experience).  And while it remains to be seen as to whether or not the author\\'s  ambition to foster a new paradigm comes to fruition,  I can say unequivocally that he has produced a work not only of exceptional rigor and clarity, but also of passionate faith.Building on the ideas of Freud and Jung and his own work as a practicing psychotherapist, Aziz goes beyond merely arguing for an expanded model of analytical theory and practice, i.e. \"for paradigmatic shift from a closed-system model of a self-regulating psyche to an open-system model of psyche in a self-regulating totality,\" (page 36), to call for a fundamental change in our perspective of the nature of reality and our place in it - \"From it\\'s very depths the collective soul of our psyche cries out to be released from its entrapment in that which has been the legacy of humanity\\'s secular and religious ideologies,\"(page 293).

And again, the video and audio quality are even better than the half-season episodes.I can recommend this set.  I\\'ll write a follow-up if I find ANY music replaced, but my guess right now is that only background music in clubs, bars, etc., has been replaced.UPDATE:  I\\'m very happy to report, again, that I believe that all, or nearly all, the music cues have been restored to their original versions.  I examined \"The White Knight\" in particular, using the excellent December 8, 2009, review posted by Robert Dahl for the 2009 release of Season 3, Volume 2.  Mr. Dahl in that review stated that, \"The White Knight is completely trashed with Heyes cues,\" and I certainly agree with his assessment of that 2009 version.  Mr. Dahl also pinpointed the exact times where 19 of the Heyes replace cues began in the version of \"The White Knight\" contained in the Season 3, Volume 2 set issued in December 2009.  I compared this prior version of the episode and the version of \"The White Knight\" just released in \"The Fugitive - The Most Wanted Edition - Complete Series.\"  I am happy to confirm that all Heyes replacement music In \"The White Knight\" is gone and what appear to me to be the original instrumental cues have been restored.I also examined \"The 2130,\" which Mr. Dahl also noted had a lot of Heyes cues, and these do appear to have all been deleted in favor of the original instrumental music.While, as another reviewer has noted, the new set just released does note that \"Some music has been replaced,\" I\\'d say if there is some replacement music, it is minimal.  So if you are a fan of The Fugitive, I\\'d buy this set without hesitation.  CBS deserves recognition for listening to the fans of this great 1960s TV series and doing it justice in this new complete series set, and the best way to do that is to buy this set.',\n",

       " \"This album contained a few surprises to fans who thought they knew what to expect from Richard and Karen. The opening track, B'wana she no home, is certainly different from anything on their earlier albums, but I like it. The album also includes Don't cry for me Argentina, but with an intro titled On the balcony of the Casa Rosado - another strange piece compared to anything that they'd released on their previous albums. However, the biggest surprise came with their cover of a Canadian song written and first recorded by Klaatu, a group otherwise unknown to me. That song's full title - Calling occupants of interplanetary craft (the recognized anthem of World Contact Day) - makes it the song with the longest title ever to make the British pop charts, where the single climbed into the top ten. On most compilations, the title is abbreviated and that can cause arguments about the length of the title. However, there are 73 letters in the main title, excluding spaces and parentheses.Elsewhere, this sounds like a typical Carpenters album. They had a surprise top ten country hit with Sweet sweet smile that, less surprisingly, became a minor British pop hit. It certainly has a country feel to it, which is something rare but not unprecedented for the Carpenters, earlier examples being Jambalaya and Top of the world. Other songs that you may be familiar with include I just fall in love again (later covered by Anne Murray, whose version was very successful) and All you get from love is a love song.One song that makes me chuckle is Man smart woman smarter, later covered by Roseanne Cash. If any man recorded the song with the genders reversed, he'd likely be lynched., but we men can take this sort of thing and laugh it off. The only track that I haven't mentioned is the excellent ballad, Two sides.This is an excellent Carpenters album, if somewhat different from its predecessors.\",\n",

       " \"This classic is as relevant today as it was when written well over a half century ago. Hayek does more than analyze the economic consequences of a planned society ... he also illustrates the political fallout of Socialism.  Hayek asserts that politically, it is impossible to be free if we are not  free economically. The reason is that those who disagree with socialism  cannot opt out and become entrepeneurs. In order for socialism to work, it  must apply to everyone. Therefore, even though a socialist might be a  supporter of democratic institutions, our freedoms must ultimately be  corroded for socialism to work, no matter how well meaning the socialist  originally may haved been. Hayek sees a limited role for government and he  uses highways as an example. We are free to travel and use the highways and  go where we please. However, there must be some basic rules that we all  agree on such as the rules that we all drive on the right side and that we  stop at red lights. So too, there is a role for government to set basic  ground rules and to provide protection for us. But.... these rules must  ultimately be in furtherance of assuring our freedom. Hayek considers  himself a liberal in the classic meaning of the term which would be  individual freedom and few governmental controls. In prefaces to the book  written decades later, Hayek stands by his use of the term  &quot;liberal&quot; to describe his views, positing that what has become  called &quot;liberalism&quot; has nothing to do with real liberalism as set  forth by earlier thinkers such as John Locke. Although written for a  British readership in 1944, this book remains highly readible (rather than  overly technical) and very relevant to today's economic and political  issues. I recommend the book highly.\",\n",
       " \"I have to admit, by this time last year I was getting pretty impatient waiting for the new Tool album. It seemed like this album would never come out, but, after dozens of delays, Lateralus is finally here. At first listen I was not impressed at all. It seemed like sort of an empty album for the first 5 tracks. &quot;The Grudge&quot; didn't really offer anything new to us Tool fans and a few of the songs that followed it weren't even really songs. But after my second listen of the album's best song, &quot;The Patient,&quot; I was hooked. Maynard's voice has really improved and he has much more melody now and isn't always as aggressive. Just about every song on here is perfect. Some may get bored because of the length of the songs and the fillers that surround them, but really, this album wouldn't have worked without those elements. &quot;Parabol&quot; and &quot;Parabola&quot; are probably two of the most noteworthy tracks, &quot;Parabol&quot; is a laid back, mellow track while &quot;Parabola&quot; is a rip-roaring, grinding song, hence, these songs hold true to the titles of their names. The last track on the album, &quot;Faaip De Oiad&quot; is probably the only filler I enjoy listening to, and is kind of amusing too. This CD is pretty much in the same vein as Aenima, but with more melody. If you didn't like Mer De Noms or were left hungry with Salival, you will definetly enjoy Lateralus.\",\n",

Pileggi wrote with an insider slant, and revealed the character and rationale for the men who ran scams, extortion and terror on the unsuspecting and not so unsuspecting.  The real horror of the people portrayed, was the lack of compassion.  These men could laugh as they tortured others.  As others were in horrible pain, these men were amused.The pace of this book, written by former Willow Springs police chief Michael Corbitt, rivals the frenetic, break neck speed of these movies.  The theme is somewhat the same, and the characters are as well.  Tony Spillotro, portrayed by Joe Pesci in \"Casino\" is a real presence in this book.  But it is the author\\'s story, and what a wild ride it was.Corbitt was a gas station owner who did some favors for Sam Giancana.  Giancana took away the gas station, but delivered a job opportunity in the form of a police job on the Summit police force.  Corbitt believed this was a low paying, dead end job.  He quickly learned the opportunity for graft was almost limitless.  His boss was one of the most corrupt men ever seen, yet was often feted by prominent politicians and judges.  Paradoxically, almost the only crime in the township was that perpetrated by the police force.  Even criminals were afraid to operate here.Corbitt tells of many high profile criminals, and the influence they had, not only in the upper echelons of our political system, but in other countries, like Panama and Iran.  Corbitt comes off as a man with a conscience, but is far from a choirboy.  He is obviously a very tough individual, yet does not ask for sympathy or absolution.  He is at the center of some of the most audacious business movement of the 20th century.His story, and his understanding of the ramifications of what he witnessed, is riveting.',\n",

It rebooted itself at least 4 times just getting through the setup.  Once setup, various OS components like touchwiz and the keyboard would crash making it impossible to use.  For about 20 minutes it degraded to a constant reboot cycle .  I did a hard reset and wiped the unit and started over.  It continued to crash and I contacted Amazon.  A new unit is on the way.  I hope the next one works better.\",\n",

       " 'After reading this book I sat for a while, totally speechless and dumbfounded. It took several minutes, a lot of \\'several minutes\\' actually, to come back to my own life and its immediate demands. I wanted to do it kicking and screaming!For a debut novel, this is surely one of the best I have ever read! There is so much I want to, and can, say, but somehow my thoughts just drifted off in a multicolored hot air balloon over the Winscombe skies. There was simply none left for me to write a suitable review with.Two women, young Rachel Moore and 84-year old Tracey Eleanor Carmichael, ended up living side by side in Apple Lane, Winscombe where Rachel moved into Dove cottage next to Tracey. The address was not only words to suit a chocolate-box address. Lacey\\'s House would open up a journey for both to finally rise above: electric shock treatments; a lobotomy; a cruel life in an orphanage; an unknown mother who valued her alcohol addiction above everything else; a monstrous doctor; an ignorant vicious community; a village outlay in the form of a question mark; a woman talking to the dead at their graves, planting roses there because it was a hated flower for that particular deceased, since in real life her words was forced inside her head for safety reasons; a cat named Peachy. And then there was Charlie...\"That\\'s the funny thing about small village life, reputations often last longer than the person themselves.\" But perceptions can be forced to change. When \"Albert was dead lying on the floor of his house with his blood serving as a cushion for his head\", the increasingly embellished tale of a witch, which was told to children in the dark of night, suddenly took a turn that would change lives forever.Without the truth, fiction is not possible. \"This story... this story is different, tantalizing, compelling\" Lacey herself said that, which saves me from using the publishing-industry\\'s neologism to sing the praise of this 2012 Luke Bitmead Bursary Award-winning book. Although there\\'s no love lost for sentimentality in the book, the same compassionate message is present as evident in my speechless state of wonder afterwards!This tale proves a theory: Anything, from an unwanted -ism to an un-addressed emotion, forced underground, takes root and flourish. People sadly and often deny it. And if it is nourished well, deeply loved, it can push up beautiful flowers to face the sun. But to become beautiful, it needs strong roots underground, in the often dark, in the uncompromising toughness of the earth. It is the only way that the perfect flowers can rise above the surface and charm the world. Even well-nourished weeds have beautiful flowers.This book addresses the wealth and strength of the human spirit in unimaginable ways. The elements used in the book, two vastly opposite life stories, with one common denominator namely the absence of love as children, are not unknown to the world at all, but the combination used in this narrative, makes it stand out way above the average novel in this genre.The conclusion is surprising and original.In the end it confronts us all, who we are and how we ended up as human beings and what became of us in the aftermath of those choices. It is not how and where we were planted,but how we utilized the nourishment bestowed on us to paint the picture we would ultimately call our chocolate-box address. What a difference attitude can make! (Margitte)',\n",

Didn't think it could possibly retail for that much so I took a trip to the local mall.  Found a mall jewelry retailer that sold the Invicta brand and they were asking significantly  for a another Invicta brand, so I placed an order through Amazon.  Received watch one day later (thanks Prime!) and this thing is GIGANTIC!!  I thought I had a larger than average wrist but I had to have some links taken out.  When I took this to the jewelry store, that were simply amazed by the size/weight of the watch.  A few ladies in the store came over and admired the watch and it weight.  Felt like I had just signed my first NBA/MLB/NFL contract and needed to spend some serious money on a watch when I put this on.The watch is very heavy and if you're not looking for a Big/Heavy watch, you might want to look for something else, but if you like attention, this watch draws people like flies to honey!!  That can be a good thing or a bad thing!!  Wearing this watch will DEFINITELY draw attention and comments.  It's hard not to notice.The watch appears to be solid, well-made and a lot of attention to detail.  I'm looking forward to years of use.  Jewelry store said battery was easy to replace when that time arises, which is good to know.  Just don't plan on wearing it under a suit or dress shirt as it might not fit!!Happy with purchase so far!!  Hope I don't end up in a roadside ditch after wearing this thing out!!\",\n",
       " 'Whoever said that the Black Keys are like the White Stripes is going on the fact that both have only two members.The Black Keys are on the Fat Possum record label, one that deals with legendary bluesmen like R.L. Burnside, Mississippi Fred McDowell, Junior Kimbrough, and Solomon Burke. It shows too. The Black Keys play dirty, nitty gritty blues, drawing from all of the aformentioned at Fat Possum. Thickfreakness was recorded in the same manner as any R.L. Burnside; it is very raw and rough around the edges. The Black Keys were going for this sound in their blues because it adds character and a certain element of, \"wow, this is bad-...\". Basically, it fits the label.Thickfreakness isn\\'t completely original, some of the songs are covers (including one of Mississippi Fred McDowell\\'s). That doesn\\'t mean it is not a good album--look at the North Mississippi Allstars\\'s record \"Shake Hands With Shorty\". It won them a Grammy and yet almost every single song was a cover from a bluesman on the Fat Possum label. They took the standard blues and made it their own, something that I believe the Black Keys have done well. The singer/ guitarist has the voice of Warren Haynes and a true mastery of the guitar that the White Stripes simply don\\'t have. The drummer is excellent too.But now you\\'re saying, \"Wait, the White Stripes have blues too\". They do. You will hear some of the same Zeppelin-esque sound in both of the bands. The Stripes are built on Zeppelin and punk, but the Keys are built on Fat Possum and Zeppelin. If you like the blues, Thickfreakness is just for you. If you\\'re expecting something a little more punk like the White Stripes, you may be dissapointed. I think that most anyone who has enjoyed listening to the delta blues, Zeppelin, or the Stones should enjoy this album tremendously.',\n",

I was really worried that they\\'d arrive looking used, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The only negative cosmetic thing with the set was that the cheap plastic sleeves each knife came in were in very rough shape. As in bent up so they will have big permanent wrinkles in the plastic sleeves and the sleeves also had long cuts in them which I taped up.  Eventually I will buy either knife guards or find a much better storage solution for them, but for now they are useable as temporary knife storage to protect the blades some.

At the Cooks Illustrated website they\\'d mentioned that Victorinox has plans to take these knives out of retail stores in 3 years so I started shopping Amazon to get another one as a backup in case I needed another one someday and I couldn\\'t get them anymore.  In addition to the 8\" chef\\'s knife I was also wanting a Victorinox 10 1/4\" bread knife so I was tickled when I found this set with both those knives and was able to get 4 knives for about the same price as the 2 knives I was shopping for.My knives arrived today and I made a loaf of bread to test out my new bread knife.  I let the loaf sit on a cooling rack for 30 minutes and then tried out my new bread knife.  I was instantly very impressed.  The interior of the bread although not hot was still very warm and moist and the bread knife sliced through it like a pro without any effort on my part and not the least bit of smashing of the bread.As everybody mentions the knives are very sharp so watch your fingers and keep them out of the reach of children.

       " 'Economic inequality is back on the agenda of economists, pundits, policy makers, and just concerned people. For the past few decades, take-home (real) wages of the majority of workers have been stagnant or in decline. Warren Buffett, a multibillionaire investor, is concerned about the trend and proposes to reverse the trend--by favoring higher taxes on the rich and superrich like himself.Mr. Buffett\\'s fundamental understanding of \"wealth\" is that unless he and his fellow millionaires and billionaires use it for charity or it is taxed away by the government, it is of no benefit to anyone in the society, other than himself.In this short book Prof. Reisman shows the many fallacies of that understanding of the role and importance of concentrated wealth under capitalism. Unlike in pre-capitalistic societies, where wealth consisted almost exclusively in consumable goods (food, clothing) and benefited only the owner, great wealth accumulated under capitalism is overwhelmingly invested and used in the production of goods for the market, i.e. productive wealth is at service of the society as a whole.The wealth of businessmen like Mr. Buffett, as Prof. Reisman demonstrates, serves workers\\' interests in essentially two ways. First, it provides literally the money to pay them wages. Second, insofar as it consists of or is used to buy capital goods, it is ultimately responsible for the supply of consumers\\' goods the workers are able to buy with the wages paid by capitalists such as Mr. Buffett.By this standard, Mr. Buffett\\'s wealth already constitutes a great source of good for the society. He can give it away, if he wishes to, in part or in whole to fight cancer, cure aids, build schools or libraries and any such worthy humanitarian goals, but if he decided not to do so and leave it invested instead, he would still be beyond reproach. Mr. Buffett and thousands and millions of other people of all levels of ability who merely engage in the prosaic task of acquiring wealth by production and exchange, do what no benevolent dictator could ever hope to achieve--run and maintain a great and complex machinery of social production at the highest speed and efficiency that provide food and comforts to millions of people. By establishing new businesses and expanding the new ones, by their relentless drive to earn profits by cutting costs, improving methods of production and management, by introducing new products and expanding markets into darkest corners of the world, businessmen and capitalists, in the very logic of these activities, are great benefactors of precisely the wage earners and everyone besides.For those steeped in Marxist understanding of capitalism, THAT must be a surprise and cosmic irony, but it is true nonetheless. Evidence is overwhelming and all around us. Products and services that were undreamed of just a few decades ago have become essential attributes of our daily lives.The lesson of Prof. Reisman\\'s book is as simple as it is profound. For the sake of human progress, for the sake of those who are poor, oppressed by illiteracy and ignorance, without jobs and many opportunities in life, wealth accumulated through peaceful production and exchange is the very means, cold and clean, to lift the poor and disadvantaged out of their poverty, misery and ignorance.Those who have truly the interests of the poor and disadvantaged at their hearts, should actively seek to provide all the incentives and means to preserve and enhance the growth of wealth accumulation by lowering taxes on property and profits, by abolishing progressive taxation and other obstacles to greater wealth. Achieve that and you will see real wages rising again. That is a truly progressive path to social harmony and shared prosperity.Study this book and if you are hooked and want answers to many easy and hard questions of theory and evidence, go and study his magnum opus Capitalism: A Treatise on Economics, which is also available on Amazon.',\n",

       " \"This is a set, and indeed this is an opera, that I would like to recommend as strongly as I can, but I think I had better not recommend them under any false pretences. To summarise at the outset what I shall try to substantiate presently, the strengths of Dvorak's Rusalka are all musical, and its shortcomings are all dramatic and literary. Much, maybe most, of the music is Dvorak at his heavenly best, but the libretto is something close to hopeless. With one exception the performers vary from good to wonderful (Blachut), but above all the direction is a priceless memorial of a musical era.The recording has been given digital remastering in 2005, butIf it be long, ay, long agoWhen I beginne to think howe longsince the performance was first captured on record, I find it was as long ago as 1952. At that time the communist authorities in cold war Czechoslovakia were intent on establishing a musical culture that would be pure and untainted by external influences. The comparative isolation of their operatic tradition was a serious handicap in serious ways, but in terms of the performers it had a great deal to be said for it. In Rusalka, as in Smetana's Dalibor, there is a special tone and atmosphere to the playing of Czech orchestras under Jaroslav Krombholc that more than compensates (to my ears) for any lack of refinement they may show when compared with their western counterparts. The singers are equally authentic, and although my own Czech never got far past such oratory as `to je muj bily kolo' and the more frequently used `pivo prosim. Za to stoi?' I think I can still enjoy the sense that these singers are at home with the words. In particular, it is something definitely special to be able to hear Beno Blachut.Where the isolation was a problem was amateurishness on the creative side. Even Smetana, a good orchestral technician as a rule, treats the unfamiliar harp clumsily in Dalibor. Dvorak has surmounted any and all orchestral hurdles (just listen to the superb harp writing in this score), but like Smetana he just takes what he is given by way of a book. What he is given in Rusalka is an overgrown fairy tale, padded out with unnecessary characters to give a few more people something to sing. The story does not amount to much, and in my opinion it will not bear any grandiose analysis trying to find parables and allegories. Two of the main characters are not human - that is the whole point of the tragedy - and it is difficult to convey their injured feelings in any non-human way, so that we are left not knowing how and with whom to empathise. There is no real structure or design to the plot, and although I don't think Dvorak has the basic theatrical sense that enabled Smetana to infuse a certain amount of real drama into the static libretto of Dalibor (which is nearly as bad as this one), there is actually some help that he gives his crippled text from his sheer musical talent.Dvorak is able through his music to give this story pace and fluency. If we stop to think we will realise that the composer is reacting with sensitivity and panache to the various situations as they succeed one another, but that the task of giving real coherency to this story is beyond any composer. Dvorak's achievement is in charming us out of concerns about anything so cerebral as coherency. He does anything that can be done, which is not much, with the plonking repetitions of `Pitiful Rusalka pallid' that are supposed to be some awesome leitmotif and which may sound better in Czech although I wouldn't bank on that. He starts with a prelude of exquisite beauty, but you may need a little forbearance with the first chorus for the three dryads. These may be intended to recall Wagner's Rhinemaidens at the start of The Rhinegold, but they spend nearly five minutes singing very little other than `Ho ho ho', and the effect may seem to you more diverting than inspiring. Keep the faith - from there on Dvorak pours out music of outstanding beauty, spontaneity and freshness all the way to the end.It must be most gratifying to sing, and the singers, except for Marie Podvalova as the Foreign Princess, whose pitch in the more energetic stretches of yelling about could be politely characterised as `approximate', really do very well. The Water Sprite, Rusalka herself, and the Witch give me few problems, but of course the star is the great and unique Blachut, although perhaps his special quality comes over even better in and as Dalibor. The chorus is full of life and verve, and I have already mentioned the orchestra. There is an elaborate and earnest liner essay, there are profiles of all the principals including Krombholc, and the full libretto is given in Czech, English, German and French. The recording is not bad at all as remastered. It is very clear and the balance of voices against orchestra is excellent. There are some uncomfortable moments with high notes, but not all that many and mainly in connexion with Podvalova for whatever reason.My strictures on the libretto, and to a much lesser extent on the music, have been in the interests of trying not to mislead any newcomers about what they can expect to find. In fact it is gorgeous music for the most part, and I find it hard to suppose that any music lover in tune with the late romantic idiom could possibly fail to enjoy the production, at least as presented to us here. I suggest that this set is well worth collecting, and if you like what you have collected add Krombholc's Dalibor as an extra Christmas treat for yourself, or for whoever you feel deserves it.\",\n",

Anyway, this unit is superbly constructed.  It is fairly lightweight but does have sharp corners, so you need to exercise a little caution if you are going to use it in your lap. From what I have experienced and researched, this is the best device of its kind on the market.  It's far from the cheapest, but remember what they say...you don't always get what you pay for, but you always pay for what you get.  If you have a heat generating power notebook, you need this cooler.  Don't even think about it.  Just order it at the same time as the computer and the price won't seem so bad.\",\n",

       " 'Rebecca Haas dives, quite deliberately, into a Jungian Night Sea Journey characterized less by disconnection than by a fierce determination to rediscover exactly what it is she\\'s connected to.  Herself, for example.  She\\'s long-divorced, her kids are grown, her writing career has stalled and her life is becalmed in a charming village Thomas Kincaid would kill to paint.  There\\'s no reason to think about moving.  Except sometimes you have to move, in order to re-member who you are.And so Rebecca begins a savvy and often hilarious tour of New York City real estate, each apartment, condo and mansion a theatrical set reflecting style-of-life possibilities.  (For non-New Yorkers actually planning to move there, this book would be a goldmine of insider detail about the \"feel\" of the city\\'s various neighborhoods.)  But the secret of this novel lies in the unstinting honesty with which Rebecca observes her own history as she anticipates her future.  Marriage, children, money.  Home repairs, food, a never-to-be-forgotten affair.  A parent lost in senility, a corporate event-planning job devoted to the utterly banal, and the faint, fraught possibility of a new lover.Among the many fictional chronicles of women\\'s lives, this is the most intelligent and sometimes painfully honest I\\'ve read.  An absolute delight.  I literally couldn\\'t put it down and it\\'s one of the very few I\\'ll read again, just to find those terrific lines that so frankly reveal things we know or think or suspect or fear, but never tell anybody.',\n",

       " 'To make such genial film you need not only the natural gift, but besides the moral conviction and the necessary force to push against all the odds this brutally eloquent portrait of the last consequences involved when you decide to be in straight line according the holly precept of a concrete theologic virtue: the charity.Just think in the historic moment the film was made. Bu&ntilde;uel was essentially an anti establishment artist , and his political posture is well known and one of his primary concerns consisted in proving that we are not in the best of the possible worlds and this statement scopes the shade of the Totalitarian Regimes in search a better world for the mankind : the search of the total welfare implies necessarily the demolition of the previous Status Quo. And if you watch with absolute coldness and free or passionless, you will feel this invisible slap in the face of the most devoted believers the human happiness can be stated. The literal mess when the alcohol make his late effects in the middle of this humble crowd , slowly and progressively goes showing the ugliness of the feelings behind the mask of good manners, creating a real atmosphere of claustrophobia and horror in the worst sense of the word. The sinister parody to the last Supper was immediately rejected by many religious sectors: Once more the forest avoided to watch the real intentions of Bu&ntilde;uel.This extraordinary, original, powerful and unforgettable film is one the supreme master jewels of the Cinema in any age.The performance of one of the most beautiful and talented actress in that age: Silvia Pinal as the prodigal nun who really believes in the fact the human still can be redeemable is simply of first rate. And the script deserves simply an everlasting applause. After you watch this merciless picture you will reformulate your inner vision about certain issues you considered out of discussion.',\n",

       " 'When I put this DVD in the player, I really did not know what kind of performance of Verdi\\'s famous opera would be.  Was it actor\\'s doing the story with singer\\'s providing the music?  Was it going to be cut horribly?  I simply did not know.  However, soon I was delighted to see that it was going to be a film of a straight performance of \"Rigoletto\", but done on a stage setup outside in a big plaza with a huge audience.Now, filming opera presents several problems because filmgoers have very different expectations than opera lovers.  First, the singers do act, but not in the way film actors act.  It is a stage performance and met to be seen from a distance, so the gestures are broad.  This also affects the close-ups of the faces that film requires.  The makeup is done to be seen from a distance and is, of course, not realistic when seen in close-up.  Second, since it is the voice that matters, it is fine for a forty year old to play the role of a very young and innocent Gilda.  Third, the timing and pacing of a 150 year old opera is very different than a modern movie.  However, this is a very compelling story with fabulous music and still captivates people.The story is quite involved, but can be summarized broadly.  Rigoletto is a hunchbacked jester for a womanizing Duke.  He aids the Duke\\'s exploits as a procurer and by his withering verbal attacks on the Duke\\'s opponents.  This has earned Rigoletto much enmity.  An old man appears at a party thrown by the Duke and puts a curse on him and Rigoletto for ruining his daughter.  The jester is quite upset about the curse and takes it seriously.Rigoletto has a daughter, Gilda, who recently came to live with him and has been mistaken by those who mean him harm as a mistress.  The Duke met Gilda at church and is intent on seducing her as well, not knowing she is Rigoletto\\'s daughter.  Events occur that leads Gilda to giver herself to the Duke and Rigoletto swears vengeance.  He hires an assassin he has met earlier and bad things happen to everyone involved.Those are the broad strokes without giving away too much of the plot.  In any case, it is the music that matters here, and it is fabulous.  This opera is more about duets than arias, and there are many kinds presented that add to the telling of the story.  The chorus is all male, which is not common in opera.  In fact, the only women are Gilda, the Countess Ceprano (a small part), and the assassin\\'s sister.This is a very nice way to see the opera in the convenience of your own home, although it won\\'t sound as beautifully as it would be in person.  Being a recording of an outdoor concert there are times the balance gets a bit out of whack, but still, it is done quite well.  It is a bit disconcerting to see the little microphones stuck in the their hair in the middle of their foreheads, but it had to be amplified for the outdoor concert.  The singing is superb.Very well done.',\n",

But it was very large and clumsy to hold on the road, required a stack of CDs and replacement batteries, and was not quite loud enough. Then we got a battery powered speaker to hook to the mp3 player via the earphone jack, but the volume was way too low. The Satechi Soundfly works perfectly. It is small, holds as many files as needed (since you can always change the USB stick), and plays with plenty of volume through the car speakers. The only negative is that the remote is iffy - sometimes you have to press the buttons over and over to get them to work, but this is not a major problem because all functions seem to be available via some rather arcane sets of key combinations on the device itself.

The only weirdness I\\'ve noticed is that it gets a little \"jumpy\" occasionally when someone walks by close to the camera.  It\\'s hardly noticable though and doesn\\'t ruin the experience.3)  Avatar 3D didn\\'t come with the kit sold as part of the bundle.  The loyalty program specifies you had to buy it before Dec 1, 2010 (I bought on cyber-Monday).  There seems to be no way of getting this 3D movie currently.4)  The stand it comes with is just a tiny mount that leaves the TV a couple of inches above the floor.  I would have ordered a TV stand that could hold the receiver, Blue-Ray, etc if I had known that.5)  Unless I\\'m missing something obvious, the Netflix streaming doesn\\'t seem to have a search feature.  You can add to your watch-instantly queue though netflix.com and see it on the list, but otherwise it just seems to have the suggestions based on the last few things you watched or rated.  Netflix streaming works great though.  If they fix this I can move my Roku to the other room.6)  The feature to automatically switch between HD and non-HD so that it always fills the screen works, but I\\'ve noticed it takes up to a second for it to switch.  Some channels with alternating analog & digital commercials then going back to HD for the content miss a second while the screen & sound are blanked occasionally.

It\\'s no \"Meteora\" or \"Hybrid Theory\" but then the band have matured and trodden different musical paths since then.Lead single \"Burn It Down\" is set to stomping beats with lyrics alluding to battle. \"I\\'ll Be Gone\" features the lyrics \"Let the sun fade out and another one rise, I\\'ll be gone\", while \"Castle Of Glass\" is a catchy bouncy tune belying the dark nature of the lyrics.\"Victimized\" finds Drummer Rob Bourdon working overtime. The lovely ballad \"Roads Untraveled\" finds Bennington singing \"The love that you lost isn\\'t worth what it cost and in time you\\'ll be glad that it\\'s gone.\"The band still find time to experiment on the quirky \"Skin To Bone\" (with swirling effects - my favourite) and the tempo-shifting reverb-laden \"Until It Breaks\" with some Dub Step touches and lovely harmonies. \"Tinfoil\" is a brief ambient instrumental, which segues into closing song, the haunting ballad \"Powerless\" with the vulnerable lines \"You held it all, but you were careless to let it fall...I was by your side, powerless\".This album strikes the right balance between the experimental and the familiar.
