    "### Review Length - Sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated earlier, we plan to investigate the effect of feeding in individual sentences into the universal sentence encoder. As we can see below, reviews are typically 5~6 sentences long. This varies between domains. Although, intially, we decided to cut down the number of sentences to include to 5 sentences, data processing became too expensive. As a result, we have reduced the number of sentences to include down to 3 sentences."
